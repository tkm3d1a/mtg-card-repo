# Frontend

This notes file will be for documenting any frontend notes.

## Initial plan

The initial plan is to have a very very basic front end just to allow access to the DB and the user data.  It will be something barebones, unsure on what to spin it up with at this point.  It will fully utilize getting any nessecary data through the custom backend API calls that will be built
